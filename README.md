<h1>AntDine App || Atrium App Alternative</h1>

<p>UCI Dining has a policy where you need to use the Atrium App to scan into their dining halls. 
  But that app requires you to sign in every time with your UCInetID. With this app you don't need
  to sign in anymore. Once downloaded, simply click the + icon in the middle and choose a screenshot of the 
  front of your ID. Then click the + icon again to choose the back of your id. Then click it one more time 
  to show your ID. Tap in the middle of the screen to rotate between pictures. If you want to reset the images, 
  click the back button in the top left.</p>

<p>You can find the downloadable APK below:</p>
